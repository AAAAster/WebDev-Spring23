<Introduction> This is a personal website of mine. My skills in photography, diving and engineering were introduced.


<Structure> It's just the main page, and it's called index. html. 
The corresponding support files are color_variable. css, Commom_style.css and Index_style.css.
  Respectively correspond to:
     - Color variable scale. Note: Only changeable colors appear here. The colors of certain elements are not defined here because of the fixed match.
    - Generic style sheets. To facilitate the development of subsequent pages, you only need to load the stylesheet, similar to the template of the base style. Note: Development is not complete
    - Home page style sheet. This style sheet controls the style of the index page.


<Interesting> Used a similar multiple page within https://www.dji.com/ronin-4d page design and page design. This is an interactive way to better guide the user to deeper understanding.
